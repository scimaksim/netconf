A brief introduction to NETCONF, outlined in RFC 6241. 

Juniper provides a free lab environment at https://jlabs.juniper.net/vlabs/portal/index.page

Cisco provides a free lab environment at https://developer.cisco.com/site/sandbox/

I recommend the always-on "NETCONF/YANG and RESTCONF on IOS XE" sandbox and the "Open NX-OS Programmability" sandbox.
